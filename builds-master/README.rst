Build the best of OpenPOWER platform virtualization
***************************************************

Considering the speed of the development of new features, or even
Hardware is created in the OpenPOWER ecosystem, it's a challenge to
get them in the traditional stable GNU/Linux distribution scenario.

open-power-host-os/builds repository is an open source collaboration
effort that aims to help administrators to build and deploy the latest
and greatest capabilities in the OpenPOWER world through a build
script that provides software well packaged and designed for the
`Supported GNU/Linux distributions`_

Supported GNU/Linux distributions
---------------------------------

* CentOS 7.3 PPC64LE


Refer to `30. How does CentOS versioning work?
<https://wiki.centos.org/FAQ/General#head-dcca41e9a3d5ac4c6d900a991990fd11930867d6>`_.

Installation
------------

RPM Based distributions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Install epel repository (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux):

::

$ sudo yum install --downloadonly --downloaddir=. epel-release
$ sudo yum localinstall epel-release-7-5.noarch.rpm # Note the version may change.

* Install RPM dependencies

::

$ sudo yum install -y $(cat rpm_requirements.txt)

Settings
--------

* Disable SMT

::

$ sudo ppc64_cpu --smt=off

* Setup environment and user

::

$ sudo python host_os.py set-env --user LOGIN

Naturally, you need to replace ``LOGIN`` by the user name you'll use
to run ``host_os.py``, which should not run using root user,
even if that user doesn't exist yet.

Please see ``--help`` for more options.

::

$ python host_os.py set-env --help


Running
-------

* Build a single package

::

$ python host_os.py build-package --package libvirt

* Build all software

::

$ python host_os.py --verbose build-package

Note the ``--verbose`` parameter to get all the log messages in the
console. Instead of the standard ordinary messages. Please see
``--help`` for more options.

::

$ python host_os.py --help

or

::

$ python host_os.py build-package --help


Using the RPMs
--------------

We decided that's is a little bit intrusive to install all the
produced RPMs since some of them may not fit your needs. At the end of
the process you'll see a new ``result`` directory inside this
project's root.

A suggested set of packages tested is the following:

 - kernel
 - libvirt
 - libvirt-client
 - libvirt-daemon
 - libvirt-daemon-config-network
 - libvirt-daemon-config-nwfilter
 - libvirt-daemon-driver-interface
 - libvirt-daemon-driver-lxc
 - libvirt-daemon-driver-network
 - libvirt-daemon-driver-nodedev
 - libvirt-daemon-driver-nwfilter
 - libvirt-daemon-driver-qemu
 - libvirt-daemon-driver-secret
 - libvirt-daemon-driver-storage
 - libvirt-daemon-kvm
 - libvirt-daemon-lxc
 - libvirt-daemon-qemu
 - libvirt-debuginfo
 - libvirt-devel
 - libvirt-docs
 - libvirt-lock-sanlock
 - libvirt-login-shell
 - libvirt-nss
 - qemu
 - qemu-common
 - qemu-debuginfo
 - qemu-guest-agent
 - qemu-img
 - qemu-kvm
 - qemu-kvm-tools
 - qemu-system-ppc
 - qemu-system-x86
 - SLOF

You can use the following command to install, for instance,
kernel's RPM:

::

$ sudo yum localinstall result/kernel-4.9.0-4.el7.centos.ppc64le.rpm

Note that some of those packages are debuginfo which are recommended
in order to provide useful information for bugs in the case of any
failures.

Also no version is informed on the list above to make it valid even
for future versions with minor version changes.

Validating
----------

There is a whole repository dedicated to testing available at
https://github.com/open-power-host-os/tests

In order to run the build scripts unit tests or code linter, you will need to
install our development dependencies.

You can do this by issuing the command below

::

$ sudo pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

Running code linter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From the root of the `builds` project directory, use the commands below to run
the code linter (Pylint):

::

$ PYTHON_FILES=$(find . -name "*.py")
$ pylint $PYTHON_FILES

Running unit tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From the root of the `builds` project directory, use the commands below to run
the unit tests:

::

$ export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd):$PYTHONPATH
$ nosetests tests/unit


ISO image
---------

* Build Host OS ISO image

::

$ python host_os.py --verbose build-iso

Please see ``--help`` for more options.

::

$ python host_os.py build-iso --help
